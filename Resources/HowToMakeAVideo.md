# How to bring your insights to the world

Human Resources has traditionally not been skilled are sharing its practices, which has slowed our growth as a profession.  When you share even one insight with the HR community, you'll be improving the work experience for people around the world. 

## What to say

If you don't know what to say, just be different.  These are some areas you can explore: 
- New blood – maybe you don’t know as much as a seasoned professional...that can be your benefit.  Exploring things with a different perspective can find problems that others don’t see
- Unknown audience – you don’t know who’s going to watch your videos.  What’s something that you can explain to an HR person who might have a very different experience from you (like someone who does HR in a very different country)
- Stealing from another profession – there are tons of practices that work well in other fields but no one has ever tried in HR.  Find something interesting from another profession and talk about how it could be implemented in HR, where it would work and where you’d need to alter it to work better
- Research – there are a ton of great academics who’s research never reaches a large audience.  Find something interesting and see if you can explain it to an HR person in a way that it changes their behavior.  There’s a good chance you could actually have the academic sit for a video and hear about their research in their own words.
- Tech training – most HR professionals don’t know as much technology as you do.  Any training you can give through and HR lens could help someone out there.  No one was born knowing this stuff.

Being insightful is like a muscle, the more you exercise it the stronger it becomes

## How to say it

Once you have an idea, turn it into a plan: 
- Work in public – the more you can post and talk about things in public, quicker you get feedback and the quicker you improve. Always be working in public a little more than you feel comfortable with.
- Everyone is bad at the start.  You’re no different.  If you don’t just do it (in public) you’re not going to get better at it.  We’re all friends here and we’ll support your (less than perfect) work if you support ours.
- This is inherently challenging – if it was easy to change the world, then it’d already be done. Finding, crafting, and explaining new ideas is one of the hardest things in the world.  
As long as you're understandable and efficient, people will forgive a lot.  Just go live with something interesting today and I promise it’ll be easier tomorrow.

### Identify the impact

Write down one sentence that will help change the practice of other HR professionals after they hear it. This will be your impact, and it's more important than any other step, so really think about it and talk to the community to refine it. We'll use this example to demonstrate:

"The 9-box system that HR uses in Performance seems like it creates structure, but in reality is systematic bias"

You can have more than one thesis statement, if for example you're training HR professionals how to use SQL, you'll have a lot small impacts that will change practices like:
- the FROM statement identifies which table you'll use to get the information you want…
- the SELECT statement is used to…
- etc.

If you're interviewing someone or running a panel, your impact could be something like:

“Bruno is relativity new to HR, which gives him a fresh perspective.  He merges this with a deep data analytics background to come up with creative content that shows…”

Although it’s not a rule, you’d like to try have no more than a minute of video for each insight.  Can you make a bullet point list of just 20 interesting things for an HR professional -> that’s ideally a 20 minute video.

### Create the wrapping first

Before you start to write a script or create questions for your guests, write up the description of your project.  Really identify WHY your impact is important.

Right now write the full description of the video (the text that will be under the video on YouTube) and the post you'll put on LinkedIn.  You'll make MUCH better videos if you do this at the start instead of doing it at the end, since this will keep the focus on your impact for the rest of your project. 

After you had the description, write the title.  You want something short, but so interesting that an HR Professional will feel guilty if they don't watch it. For example:

"Your 9-box is hurting your team but we can fix it"

With your title and description you'll create your thumbnail.  This is the image you'll use to get people to watch your video.  It needs to be visually interesting, but also extremely simple. It's probably a few words and a photo of someone (you or your guest or the person you're talking about).

"9 box problems holding your teams back"

We do try to be a little more professional than the average YouTube Channel, so a photo of you is really good, but try not to make a “grumpy” or “very confused” expression where you’re pointing at something like more mainstream creators. Think about what you'd like your next hiring manager to see. Put up a photo that will get you a job in HR, not as an improve comic. 

## Scheduling

### Live Content 

If you're doing a live session, you should has your title, description, and thumbnail all built over a month before your scheduled talk. Send that to John Kelly and I'll create a YouTube event for you.  Take the link to that event and create a LinkedIn invitation (which also uses the same thumbnail, title, description you already created. 

Postings the LinkedIn event about a month before is the only way to get a good audience.  Every week has a new post about it either by you or by one of your guests (you can schedule them).  Have everyone you know "instantly repost it" within an hour of each posting for maximum impact. 


### Scripted Content

If you're doing scripted content (something that's not live), just talk to John about what other content is scheduled.  He can tell you what you need to do to get it posted by a specific date or to schedule it for the future, if timing is important to you. 

## Crafting your story

The key thing for your video is the impact. Keep thinking about that for the next few steps. 

Everything we do has some form of a script, since that's the way to keep us centered around our impact. How that looks is up to you. It could be:
- an intro, closing and over an hours worth of questions to ask a panel (even if you hope to get questions from the audience) - [here is a guide](https://github.com/LookHere/HumanResourcesScience/blob/main/Resources/Interviews.md) on how to craft questions for an interview 
- bullet points for a scripted video, that tell you what to say in each paragraph 
- a word-by-word script to read from a teleprompter
- a shot list identifying the images/graphics and what you want to say over each one

It's a really good idea to workshop this with the community. They'll help you stay focused on your impact and tell an easier to understand story.  It's much easier to work out now instead of after you start filming. 

## Filming 

The first priority is your impact. 
The second priority is crafting your story.
The third priority is making it easy to watch. 

There is a lot you can do in how you film something to make it easier for the audience to watch. 

A phone might give you better quality than a Webcam (test it out) but neither will be anywhere near an actual camera, even a cheap one.  John uses a Canon R8, but there are much cheaper options that are still much better image quality than a Webcam.

Your camera needs to be a little lower than your eye level (have the lens about 3 inches closer to the ground than your eyes are.  If the viewer is slightly looking up towards you it gives your words more authority (reminding people of what it's like to be a kid and listen to a beloved teacher or caregiver).

It's really helpful to have a light behind or slightly above the camera, especially if you can have more of the light focus on you than the background. If you're the brightest thing in the image, you'll get more attention. 

It's powerful to have the subject (you) in focus and have your background slightly out of focus.   That's how your eyes work in the real world when they focus on something important in 3 dimensional space.  In the photography world the blurry background is called [bokeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh) so search how to change the aperture on your camera to achieve that effect.

A cluttered background will distract people from your message. This isn't a zoom call with your friends, it's a video that'll represent you for years, so spend some time cleaning up your mess, at least the part the camera can see. 

Cameras see light differently than we do, so it's often challenging if you have a window or a light in the background. Make a test video first to see how the camera sees your scene.

Although it's tempting, don't take the shortcut and use a background blur digital filter (like is common on zoom calls). It will deflate the professional quality of your video, having people take it less seriously, and it won't age well as technology improves.

If you have guests, try to help them by showing them how to look better 

## Sound

Sound is the most important part of a video.  If you have poor sound quality, then no one will watch the video.  Using airpods in a cafe isn't going to work.  If you don't have a quite space, try to record in a closet; the clothing will absorb the outside sound.  If you can, having a real microphone helps a lot.

## Screen Recording

If you'd like to do something to record your screen, [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is a free, open source software that can record both the screen and your webcam at the same time.

## After it's live

After it goes live, you'll use the same YouTube link to share it with people who want to watch later. Create another few LinkedIn posts about it (we'd suggest at least 3 scheduled over the next few weeks) from you and your guests since some of the audience isn't on LinkedIn as much as we are. If you're proud of it, keep posting about it years later, whenever it's relevant.  How about making a video about a holiday and then you can hype it up every year? 


## Continuous improvement

Working in HR we know the incredible value of a diversity of voice, so from the start it was important to us to bring many perspectives.  The point of this guide is to make it easier for you to create something.  After you read this, think about the gap between 1. your great idea and 2. posting your video.  Talk to the community about that gap, so we can better help remove it.
