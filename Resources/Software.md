We are always looking to partner in bringing important ideas to the world.  If anyone would like to work with us on a video, reach out in the linkedin group [Human Resources Science](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12704693/) and let us know.  No matter what your skill level is, you've got someting interesting to share with the world and we want to help get it out.

Here are the tools that we use (after trying many others) if it helps you get your project off the ground.  The top level bulletpoints are free software (many of which are open source) that are popular enough to have a lot of youtube how-to videos to remove some of the hurdles.  If you have a little extra money, the second level are paid alternatives that might help you spend less time in the editing phase so you have more time to develop tight scripts.  You also have the option to just pay someone on [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/categories/video-animation/buy/video-editing/youtube-videos?source=drop_down_filters&ref=service_type%3Ayoutube_videos%7Cseller_level%3Atop_rated_seller)  which could be a good investment if this video helps you get a better job.

- [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/welcome) - although it works for streaming live, OBS is also really great and easy for capturing webcam, screen, or sound on your computer.  I'd estimate it to take about half an hour to set up all of your connections (something you only need to do once) and then it's trivial to record going forward.
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - although known for 2d and 3d animation, Blender actually has a really powerful video editing tool.  It does everything you need to cut between different video and audio (if slightly worse UX than some competitors).  It even does chroma-key (green screen) really well.  Editing always takes a lot of time, so try to simplify your video so you spend more time creating and less time cutting.
  - The two big "free" competitors are [hitfilm express](https://fxhome.com/product/hitfilm) and [davinci resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve); although they might be slightly easier to use, they limit the output resolution, while Blender lets you export at any resolution.
  - [Filmora Wondershare](https://filmora.wondershare.com/) is a paid AI powered tool that one of our creators recomends to speed up the editing process
  - [GlossAi](https://glossai.co/) is another paid Ai editor that a different creator likes, that makes it easy to cut something into multiple formates, (like make a full length video and then turn it into a youtube short).
  - [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) a different paid Ai editor that edits based on text (like editing a script) and then cuts down the video for you.
  - The common paid version of this would be something like [Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html).
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) - We all need some images and graphics for things like title-cards and inkscape is really powerful and not too hard to use.  It's vector based (not pixel based) which doesn't really matter for this work, but it does have some real benefits if you want to do some more advanced stuff.  There are event ways to create a template and then have [inkscape fill it with data from a CSV file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=984Kz1_8dGQ) that lists things like which titles, colors, and pictures to use.
  - A good free alternative to this is [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), which I used to use a lot, but I think the UX is more challenging for the stuff I work on.
  - The common paid version of this would be something like [Photoshop](https://photoshop/).
