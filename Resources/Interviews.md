# How to conduct an interview

## Main goal
Conducting interviews can be a bit challenging if you've never done it before.  Although people focus on the public speaking aspect of it, the most important piece is developing interesting content.  In our context that means something that HR Professionals haven't heard before.  If your interview and find that (and cut away the other stuff) it'll be successful.

## Finding something interesting

The best way to find something interesting about a subject is to do some research on them.  

Instead, try to take a step back and see what make this person special in comparison to other people you might want to interview.
- What do they know that most HR people don't know?
- What's an experience they've had that more people haven't?
- Why would someone want to listen to them?

## Cutting out the average

There is some value to showing the speakers context (talking about their experience) or perspectives (their opinions on things), but that rarely gets to the really interesting stuff.  

Focus a question or two about that at the start, but try to have it crafted to them.  You already know a little about them, so mention what you've know and then ask them about a part you don't know.

Take a look at all of your questions and make sure that you limit your standard questions to a few (mainly at the start) and that everything else gives them space to be smart about an area they know about.

## Asking them what to ask

Professional journalists have time and experience to craft exciting questions to gather surprising responses (and even still they often fail).  Our work is often more collaborative with the guest, so feel free to ask them beforehand what type of areas they like to discuss.  If they tell you what areas they find interesting, it gives you the opportunity to research those areas and come up with good questions around them.

## Example

We were planning to interview Shally Steckerl who does HR Sourcing.  We did some research on him and found he has his own show, Shally's Alley.  Between that and his books we had enough to craft some questions.  Also we asked him the areas he wanted to talk about.  Below is the actual process we went through.

What is Shally's Alley?


#### Source 3

Shally’s Alley is a weekly video segment broadcast live on Fridays at 1pm US Eastern Time. It started as a small Facebook Group at the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to keep in touch with colleagues and maintain a positive mindset.

Like a “group chat” or “virtual coffee hour” we would hop on a video call and discuss what was on our minds. It served to lift our spirits and keep us connected, then grew into something much bigger that gives back to the community. After the group reached 3,000 members I bought some streaming tools and started broadcasting live on LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube and Twitch directly from Zoom. Now thousands of people watch live as I have meaningful conversations with featured guests from all areas of Talent Acquisition and Human Resources!

From what I am told by guests the appeal is that I keep things raw and practical, nothing contrived. The show is free for anyone to view. We have no sponsors, ads, monetization or commercial ties of any kind.

Topics: TA transformation and TA leadership burning issues of the day, and leading through rapid change, with a lens on finding or attracting talent.

Audience: Global. The largest following is from (in declining order): US, UK, Canada, India, EU.

### Conversation with the guest

 John Kelly IV (He/Him) 9:26 AM

> What areas would you like to explore on the call? 
>
> We're still building an audience, but so far it's been more of the HR Data side.  Is there anything from your experience that you feel would be especially interesting to them?
>
> I think a lot of HR data people have never done sourcing or recruiting.  Is there anything that they should know about your specialty that would help them develop better tools for what you do?  
>
> I'd also love to hear about what it's like to run Shally's Alley.  Any lessons learned on putting that together or insights for how to talk to guests?
>
> This is the type of crowd to help work through how data can be better used in sourcing and recruiting and how automation fits into the talent acquisition equation.   
>
> Those are just a few areas I think could be cool, but I'm very open to bring this in any direction you want.

Shally Steckerl 10:08 AM

> All that works, I do best when asked questions. I’m big on data issues like data hygiene, ethics (particularly when making projections with data), report automation, the important of visualization, less is more (when it comes to metrics and dashboards). For sourcing its important to track data that recruiters don’t normally track or even care much for such as source quality, conversion ratios, message deliverability, contact collision. We’ll have lots to discuss :) 






### Final list of questions we crafted

Shally, thank you for being our guest this week.

We all know if your amazing achievements 
    • sourcing candidates for some of the world's top companies
    • Hosting your own weekly show Shally's Alley (which is Fridays at one o'clock, right after our show)
    • Publishing 3 books
And the list goes on.

But tell us about your origin story. How do you look back on your career? What were some of the highs and lows?
‐-------

I saw on one of your websites that you had over 200 guests on Shally's Alley. That's come along way from a Facebook group during covid. What made you you want to start the program and what's some stuff you've learned over time. 

------

Without naming names, what was the thing that your worst guest did that made it a challenging episode?

-----

On the other side of that, what was the biggest eye opening moment you've been shocked by from one of your guests

‐‐‐‐--

We've just come out of 2023, the year of Ai hype, but also if the bitcoin crash. What areas of HR do you think applying technology will successfully growing this year, and which do you think will fizzle out?

------

Talk to me a little about the difference between Sourcing and Recruiting. A lot of people outside HR think the same person finds candidates and interviews them. Why doesn't that work well at scale and what are the differences skills and culture between them. 

Have you seen an evolution between these two roles over time?

------

A lot of our audience are coming from the People Analytics or HR Tech side. As an epic sourcer, what tools and analytics do you think we should be building to help people like you find better Talent. 

-----

What are the things that help someone get a job in Sourcing...and what are the things that they actually have to be good at on the job at an advanced level. 

---- 

Where's Talent Acquisition going to be in 10 years from now?

--------

There is a lot of talk about using AI in the hiring process.  New York recently enacted local law 144 of 2021 around automated employment decision tools.  Can you talk a little about how you see the ethics of both human and computer decisions.  What are some ways that either might hit a complex ethical issue.

-------
Ai's not going to replace the advanced Sourcing you do, but if some technology did, what area would you move into?
